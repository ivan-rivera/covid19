This little dashboard aims to present some useful stats about the COVID-19 pandemic. This data is updated daily and it is based on the [Pomber API](https://github.com/pomber/covid19) which itself obtains it directly from [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Note that the colour scale of the map is logged, also note that Latest Growth is simply today's totals divided by yesterday's totals minus one. You can view the [repository of this project here](https://github.com/ivan-rivera/covid19).
